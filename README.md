# Personalised-Cancer-Diagnosis
This machine learning case study involves analyzing Memorial _**Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)**_ data for predicting the effect of _**genetic variations in the cancer tumors**_ for enabling personalised medicine.
By given data, we classify the given **genetic variations/mutations** based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

## General info

A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.

But this is only partially happening due to the huge amount of manual work still required. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) launched this competition, accepted by the NIPS 2017 Competition Track,  because we need your help to take personalized medicine to its full potential.

Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). 

Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

It is important to develop a machine learning algorithm, that automatically classifies genetic variations.
